# Qsort

## Introduction
Qsort is a mobile app to help UX designers / researchers carry out quick card sorting experiments at scale, allowing them to quickly gather the necessary information required to organize the hierarchical information architecture of a website.


Card sorting is a tool used by UX designers and researchers to design or evaluate the information architecture of a site. In a card sorting session, participants organize labels into categories that make sense to them and they may also help re-label some categories or labels. Card sorting can be done with the use of actual cards, sticky notes, pieces of paper,
or an online card-sorting software.

## Benefits

Card sorting helps to understand your users' expectations and understanding of the websiteâ€™s labels. It is often most useful once you have done some research to find out about the users and understand the content.
Knowing this information can help the researcher:

Build the structure for your website

Decide what to put on the homepage


Label categories and navigation


## Design
Qsort is built based on Google Firebase and aimed at providing UX designers and participants to do quick and remote real-time card sorting. At the welcome page, users can choose their identity.

UX designers are allowed to create projects by importing web-design labels and categories through a .CSV text file, and give project-exclusive access to their participants with unique code and QR code through email.
Participants with access code are allowed to do card sorting experiments on Qsort. To be
more specific, they are able to do label-category navigations and leave text and voice
comments. 

Qsort can manage the card sorting results from all participants and give analyzed feedback
to UX designers.
